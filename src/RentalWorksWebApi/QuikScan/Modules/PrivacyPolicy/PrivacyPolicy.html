      The QuikScan client uses HTML5 local storage and session storage to store information that we use to improve the usability of our 
      application.  Local storage
      provides a place to store information that persists after the application has exited, while Session storage provides a place to store data while 
      the application is running.  We use local storage to store some personal information such as your login email address, so we can default your
      email address on the login screen.  We use Session Storage to store some personal information such as 
      your name, so that we can display who is logged in to the application.
