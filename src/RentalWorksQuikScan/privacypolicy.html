		<div class="sectionTitle">Privacy Policy Scope</div>
		<div class="sectionText">
		  This privacy policy applies to the RentalWorks QuikScan app, services, RentalWorks database, and other RentalWorks
		  products.  The privacy policy addresses the use of your information by Database Works.  This privacy
		  policy does not address the use of your information by our customers who purchase the RentalWorks system for their

		<div class="sectionTitle">Client Software</div>
		<div class="sectionText">
		  The RentalWorks QuikScan client uses HTML5 local storage and session storage to store information that we use to improve the usability of our 
		  application.  Local storage
		  provides a place to store information that persists after the application has exited, while Session storage provides a place to store data while 
		  the application is running.  We use local storage to store some personal information such as your login email address, so we can default your
		  email address on the login screen.  We use Session Storage to store some personal information such as 
		  your name, so that we can display who is logged in to the application.

		<div class="sectionText">
		  RentalWorks QuikScan uses stateless web services to transfer data between the RentalWorks QuikScan client and the RentalWorks Database.
		  Your personal information may be accessed by the web services in order to fulfill web requests made by the client.  Any personal
		  information that is stored by the services is stored in the RentalWorks Database.

		<div class="sectionTitle">Database</div>
		<div class="sectionText">
		  The RentalWorks database stores personal information about you in your user or contact record and is used for purposes
		  related directly to providing RentalWorks services, such as authentication, security, sending out emails, auditing who made changes to a record, and
		  other functionality needed as part of the RentalWorks system.

		<div class="sectionTitle">How Database Works Uses Your Personal Information</div>
		<div class="sectionText">
		  Database Works may have access to your personal information obtained through RentalWorks QuikScan products and services, particularly if we are 
		  hosting RentalWorks.  Database Works does not collect information from our customer's databases, however we do need to use the information at
		  times in order to provide support, system maintenance, design, enhancements, testing, or similar activities necessary to maintain the system
		  for our customers.  We consider information in our customer's databases to be private and confidential and we will never sell or
		  use the information for any purpose other than to maintain the software.
		</div>
		<div class="sectionText">
		  If we have your contact information on file, we may occasionally use it to contact you about the software, but mostly for support related purposes.
		  We do not have anyone on staff spamming people every day and so you don't have to worry about that, but we may on a rare occasion contact you about
		  some new products or features that we think you might need.
